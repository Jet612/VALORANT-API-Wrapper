Getting a Riot API Token
========================

You will need a Riot Games API token to use 90% of the VALORANT API. You can get one by following these steps:

1. Go to `developer.riotgames.com <https://developer.riotgames.com/>`_.
2. Login with your Riot account.
3. Click on "Register Product".
4. Click on either "Personal API Key" or "Production API Key".
5. Fill out the form.

A Production API Key could take up to a month to receive. (I'm not sure if this is always the case, make sure to check Official Riot Games Documentation for more information.)

More information can be found in the `Riot Games Developer Documentation <https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/portal#product-registration>`_.
